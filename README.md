# rock_paper_scissors

This version is a based on @loookingcoolonavespa 's og.index file which contains the javascript inline. 

A pseudocode file was added, which inludes goals and plain language version of the code.

I have made minor changes to their origional program, but for the most part, it remains the same as the origional. 

This experience taught me how to decompose code into psedocode, how to create functions, call them, handle user input, 
alerts and much more.

Best,
